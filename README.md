### Data Cleaning and Validation
- Ensure consistency (e.g., Yes/No instead of Y/N/True/False).
- Add links as references.
- Use filters or conditional formatting for segmenting

### Research Methodology

### Data Analysis

Use Excel or Google Sheets. Here’s a starter structure:
Company     Segment        Pricing         Features      Crypto      Mobile     License     Rating      Notes
Escrow.com  Global         0.89%–3.25%     API,licenced   No          No         Yes(US)     4.5         Most trusted
Kleros      Crypto         Gas + fees      Smartcontracts Yes         Yes         No          4.1        Web3 native

### Results/Findings

- Most leading escrow companies have a global footprint, with firms like Escrow.com, Payoneer, and Fiverr dominating cross-border transactions.
- Regional players like Troco (Nigeria), Payscrow (Africa), and Trustpay (Central/Eastern Europe) focus on localized commerce and P2P transactions.
- Crypto-native solutions such as Kleros and Uniscrow serve emerging decentralized ecosystems.
- The dominant model is transaction-based fees, typically between 0.5% to 5% per transaction.
 - Subscription and flat-fee services are seen in enterprise-focused platforms (e.g.Alibaba).
 - Platforms like Fiverr and Freelancer Escrow add layered fees for service facilitation, withdrawal, and project milestones.
 - Web3 solutions leverage token economics (e.g., Kleros with PNK token).

### Recmondation

1. Target High-Growth Segments:
   - Launch crypto-fiat hybrid escrow for Web2/Web3 crossover users.
   - Expand in Africa/SEA with localized pricing (e.g., flat fees in local currencies).
2. Differentiate on Pricing:
   - Introduce volume discounts for SMEs (e.g., 1% fee for >$1M/year transactions).
   - Offer subscription plans for freelancers/marketplaces.
3. Leverage Technology:
  - Develop API-first solutions for B2B integrations.
  - Add smart contract templates for automated milestone releases.
4. Improve Trust Signals:
  - Pursue licenses in key markets (EU/US) to compete with Escrow.com.
  - Boost transparency (e.g., public dispute resolution logs).

### Limitations

Lack of transparency in crypto-based models (e.g., Kleros’ revenue).
Regional pricing variability (e.g., Troco’s Naira fees vs. USD-based competitors).

### Reference

- Competitor websites, pricing pages, SEC/FCA filings (for licensed entities).
